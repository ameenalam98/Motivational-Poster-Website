This is a simple motivational poster website made with HTML and CSS concepts that I have learned recently.

The website contains the use of the following CSS styles:
-> Inline CSS
-> Internal CSS
-> External CSS
It also involves the use of a few CSS selectors:
-> Element Selector
-> Class Selector
-> ID Selector
-> Attribute Selector
-> Universal Selector
Other concepts:
-> CSS Colours
-> Font Properties
-> CSS Box Model
